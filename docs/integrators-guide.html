<pre id="build">
How to build the library ?
==========================

The library comes with the latest sources concatenated and minified inside
axel/axel.js. However it is wised to make a fresh version by running the
"build.lib" target in the scripts directory ("cd scripts" then "ant
build.lib"). This requires that you install the Yahoo UI compressor onto your
machine, and that you edit the "scripts/ant.properties" file to point to it.

You can get the Yahoo UI compressor at http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/
</pre>

<pre id="debug">
How to build the library for debugging purpose ?
================================================

Follow the instructions above with "build.debug" target instead. The generated
library will be a concatenated version of all the library files including
comments, which is more convenient for debugging purpose. This does not
requires to installe the Yahoo UI compressor. 
</pre>

<pre id="include">
How to select which source files to include into the library ?
==============================================================

The files to include into the library are defined by the "core.lib.files",
"editor.lib.files", "devices.lib.files", "filters.lib.files",
"services.lib.files" and "util.lib.files" in the "scripts/ant.properties"
file. You can remove some files to generate a smaller library. 

The dependencies between the source files are explained in the
"How to know which files to include in the library ?" entry of this FAQ>
</pre>

<pre id="loading">
How to choose between the basic XML loading algorithm or the robust one ?
=========================================================================

When loading XML data in a template with xtiger.util.Form.loadData, as
described in the tutorial, the library uses the XML loading algorithm defined
by the defaultLoader property of xtiger.editor.Generator. That property is set
by the latest of the two source files "xmlrobustloader.js" and "xmlloader.js"
which is included in the library. The basic algorithm is set as the default
one in this distribution (i.e. "xmlloader.js" is included after
"xmlrobustloader.js").

Alternatively you can explicitly set the loader object by calling the
setLoader method of xtiger.util.Form with either a new
xtiger.editor.RobustLoader, or a new xtiger.editor.BasicLoader argument to
select respectively the robust or the basic algorithms (in that case do not
forget to include either "xmlrobustloader.js" or "xmlloader.js" into the
library).

The robust loader uses a greedy algorithm for loading XML data. It supports
some forms of backward compatibility at the data level when a template has
been modified. The drawback is that the template must conform to a set of
restrictions on the full XTiger XML specification. The modifications
themselves are limited to a restricted set of modifications. Both the XTiger
XML restrictions and the allowed modifications are defined in a "Guidelines
for writing robust XTiger XML templates" document written by Antoine Yersin
which is available on demand (contat us).

In conclusion be very careful if you want to use the robust XML loading
algorithm. In particular USING THE ROBUST XML ALGORITHM ON TEMPLATES WHICH ARE
NON ROBUSTS may lead to some data loss and distortions when editing data.  
</pre>
      
<pre id="core">
How to test the core features of the library after checkout ?
=============================================================

The first thing to do is to open test/auto/loadSave.xhtml and to hit the "Run
Test" button at the upper right, within each browser and on each operating
system that you intend to support.

The test configuration is described in test/auto/configuration.js, hence you
can also customize it with your own test. Each test is defined by a template
and an XML sample data file produced with the template. The test will load the
template, transform it, load the XML sample data, dump the XML data, and
compare it with the initial data. It FAILS if there is a difference, which
means something is wrong. You are encouraged to create your own configuration
and make extensive tests on your own data when ugrading the library to a newer
version.

Currently all the tests configured by default PASS on Firefox 3, Safari 4,
Opera 10.

The tests with the "wiki" filter (Fiche-Projet and Article) FAIL on Internet
Explorer 7 & 8, we will debug this later, in the meantime do not use these
filters on IE. The tests with the "richtext" plugin FAIL on Opera and Internet
Explorer 7 & 8. This is due to some minor differences in the serialization
results. However it doesn't mean the plugin is not functional but only that
different browsers give different HTML serializations which are all valid and
can be viewed in any browser.

All the tests above can be executed directly from the file system on Firefox
3, Safari 4, Internet Explorer 7 & 8, Opera 10, on Windows, Mac OS X, and
Ubuntu. For Google Chrome there is a security restriction that prevents to
open URLs with XMLHTTPRequest from the file:// domain. In that case you must
launch the test from behind a Web server (see "How to configure
scripts/server/server.rb to execute the tests" if you want to use the test
server provided with AXEL).
</pre>

<pre id="interactive">
How to test the interactive features of the library after checkout ?
====================================================================

The second thing to do is to test the library with user interactions. There
are two ways to proceeds, unfortunately none is automatized yet and requires
user interaction...

The first way is to open each pre-defined template distributed with the
library from the test/gui folder inside a target browser. There should be
different templates for the core library and each of the plugins. Each
template imports the AXEL library which has been generated inside the axel
folder (see "How to build the library ?") and transforms itself to become
auto-editable. Then follow the instructions of each template that describe
some interactive tests to performs.

The second way is to open editor/editor.xhtml, select a template (Page
shortcut drop down list) and hit the "Visualize" button to generate the
corresponding editor and enter data. You can also use the preferences button
to load XML data inside a template.

Here are some possible tests:

- open Curriculum.xhtml template and load ../data/cvHaddock.xml
- open Carte-Resto.xhtml template and load ../data/carteResto1.xml or
  ../data/carteResto2.xml
- etc. (all the sample templates are in the templates folder)

You can also directly test your own template by entering its path by hand. We
strongly advice that you do so with your own template and test the interactive
features before upgrading the library to a newer version.

The editor.xhtml application can be run directly from the file system with
Firefox 3, Safari 4, Opera 10 and Internet Explorer 8. It renders the
templates inside an iframe. This is convenient as it also loads the external
CSS files. We have some problems with Internet Explorer 7 not loading
correctly the templates (MIME-Type sniffing issue, and/or not injecting the
AXEL style sheet inside the iframe). In that case you can use
editor/editornoframe.xhtml that does the same thing but without an iframe. The
drawback is that in that case any external CSS files included by the template
will not be loaded.

For your convenience you can also open demos/index.html that contains links to
several demonstrations; they are built the same way editor/editor.xhtml (i.e.
an iframe).     
</pre>

<pre id="api">
How to learn about AXEL API to load and transform templates into editors ?
==========================================================================

You should read the AXEL tutorial that starts in
examples/tutorial/tutorial.xhtml

Alternatively you can look at the source code of:

- editor/editor.xhtml or demos/launch.xhtml : to see how to load a template
  and transform within an iframe
- editor/editornoframe.xhtml : to see how to load a template with an Ajax
  request and transform it to a div in your application Web page
- examples/standalone/curriculum.xhtml (NOT YET AVAILABLE) : to see how to
  transform a Web page into an "editable" Web page by directly embedding the
  template within it
</pre>

<pre id="write">
How to write portable (cross-browser) templates ?               
=================================================    

Use the file templates/Template.xhtml as a starting point for your templates
</pre>

<pre id="serve">
How to Serve portable (cross-browser) templates ?               
=================================================                      

We do not have a definitive answer. But we have noticed the following facts.

From the local file system, to open a template file either in a Web page or in
an iframe, the file should have a .xhtml extension. In addition for Internet
Explorer you should include the following META tag (it seems the META tag
prevails for MIME-type sniffing when opening file from the local file system):

&lt;meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />

From the local file system, to open a template with the XMLHTTPRequest object
or with an ActiveX object, we have no opinion :)

From a Web server, to open a template file either in a Web page or in an
iframe you should serve it with the "application/xhtml+xml" MIME type for all
browsers excepted for Internet Explorer. For IE you should serve it with a
"text/html" MIME-type. Be careful however that the "text/html" MIME-Type will
fail on all the other browsers. Hence you should implement content-type
switching on the server.

Alternatively you can server a template from a Web server to an XMLHTTPRequest
object or an ActiveX object. It seems that in that case the best thing to do
is to serve it with a "text/xml" MIME-type which is acceptable on all the
browsers.
</pre>
      
<pre id="test">
How to configure scripts/server/server.rb to execute the tests ?
================================================================

scripts/server/server.rb starts a Web server that listen on port 8042
(http://localhost:8042/demos/index.html) and that serves the full library
distribution.

You can use it to launch the sample applications and do some testing from
behind a Web server in case you have problem to launch them from within the
file system. Read the previous entry "How to Serve portable (cross-browser)
templates" to learn how to properly configure their MIME-Type.

The server.rb script does not implement contextual MIME-TYPE switching, hence
you must set your own by hand depending on the case, and using an instruction
such as my_mime_types.update({"xhtml" => "text/html"}) (see the source code).
</pre>

<pre id="plugins">
How to get some documentation about the available plugins ?
===========================================================

This is a weak point we are working on. As a starting point we are writing
some How-To style guides in the docs folder. We currently have a
link-plugin-howto.txt guide for the "link" plugin, a photo-plugin-howto.txt
guide for the "photo" plugin and a video-plugin-howto.txt guide for the
YouTube "video" plugin.

The "string" and the "text" (which should be preferred) plugins are described
in the specification (the XTIger-XML-spec.html document in the docs folder).

Alternatively you can have a look at the templates given as example in the
templates folder, more specifically the Editors.xhtml and the Plugins.xhtml
templates should be seen as catalog files of existing plugins. 
</pre>
     
<pre id="documentation">
How to build some documentation from the source files ?    
=======================================================     

We have started to experiment with using JSDoc style comments to automatically
generate documentation from the source files. However at that moment only very
few files have been properly commented. However if you want you can try to
generate the documentation with the "build.doc" target defined in the ant
script in scripts/build.xml. You must first install JSDoc-toolkit and sets its
path inside the "jsdoc.generator.dir" property of the scripts/ant.properties
file. The documentation will be generated in the folder defined by the
"doc.build.dir" property and that defaults to docs/jsdoc.

Let us know if you think JSDoc style documentation is more important than
writing a separate developer's manual, since we are still balancing between
both alternatives. Meantime if you want to learn about the intricacies of the
library you should directly read the comments inside the source code.

You can get JSDoc-toolkit at http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/    
</pre> 
<pre id="files">
How to know which files to include in the library ?    
===================================================     

All the files in "src/core" are required except "iebrowser.js" which is
required only to run on Internet Explorer.

All the files in "src/editor/classical" are required except "string.js" and
"xmlrobustloader.js". "string.js" is required only if your templates use the
'string' primitive editor. "xmlrobustloader.js" is required only to use the
robust loader algorithm. In that case you can omit "xmlloader.js" if you don't
use the basic loader algorithm. You must leave "xmlloader.js" after
"xmlrobustloader.js" to set the default loader algorithm to the basic one.

You need the files in "src/plugins" according to the primitive editors you use
in your templates:

text.js: 'text' primitive editor (depends on text.js device)

select.js: 'select' primitive editor (depends on popup.js device)

link.js: 'link' primitive editor (depends on popup.js device)

richtext.js: 'richtext' primitive editor (depends on popup.js device)

photo.js: 'photo' upload primitive editor (depends on popup.js, upload devices
          and documentid.js filter)

video.js: 'video' primitive editor for YouTube video 
          (depends on popup.js device)

You need the files in "src/devices" according to the primitive editors you use
in your templates as stated above. For your information:

text.js: input and textarea text entry fields 

popup.js: popup menu that may segmented

lens.js: generic lens device (mega popup) for all lens based primitive editor

upload.js: transfers a file (image file) to a server through an iframe
  requires a server that implements a corresponding communication protocol

autocomplete.js: communication layer for the 'autocomplete' filter
  requires a server that implements the autocomplete protocol 
  (this is not yet available in public release)

You need the files in "src/filters" according to the filters you use in your
template. The only exception are "service.js" which is required to use
services and "documentid.js" which is required to use the 'photo' primitive
editor. For your information:

common.js: 'noxml' filter 

documentid.js: 'documentid' filter to be used with 'photo' plugin

wiki.js: 'wiki' filter of the 'text' primitive editor
  (still some bugs on IE)

image.js: image inclusion by URL filter of the 'text' primitive editor
  initially developed for the Article.xhtml template

layout.js: 'layout' filter of the 'text' primitive editor used in the
  Story.xhtml template to edit CSS within a document (does not run on IE)

video.js: YouTube 'filter' of the 'text' primitive editor, alternative to
'video' plugin

service.js: 'service' filter for each of the primitive editors
  required if you  intend to use services

debug.js: 'debug' filter for each of the primitive editors

autocomplete.js: 'autocomplete' filter for 'text' editor (depends on
autocomplete.js and popup.js device, not yet available in the public release)

You need the files in "src/services" if you use the services and depending on
the services you use in your templates. For your information:

service.js: required if you use any service       

All the other files are optional and only needed if you use the corresponding 
service (i.e. &lt;xte:service key="..." types="service-identifier"/>  )

common.js: 'copy' and 'copycond' (conditional copy) services

capitalize.js: 'capitalize' service
  for demonstration purpose, used in templates/Services.xhtml
               
debug.js: 'debug' service    

date.js: 'date' service (supports constraints between start date and end date)

suggest.js: 'suggest' service, implement a client-server protocol to fetch 
  and present suggestions to update primitive editor's content model
  (depends on popup.js device, not yet available in the public release)     
  
The files in "src/util" are optional:

ioutils.js: only required if you are using xtiger.util.Logger  

debug.js: defines xtiger.debug.load which works with local file system on
          Internet Explorer.
